        <p>
          I am currently in my second year of a master’s program in Applied
          Informatics, having previously graduated with a bachelor degree in Automation
          and Computer Science. I have a strong passion for web development and
          have gained practical experience working with various technologies
          such as Java, C#, relational and non-relational databases, React,
          HTML, and CSS. My background in both software development and system
          automation provides me with a solid foundation to build scalable and
          efficient applications across multiple platforms.
