          <p>
            I am currently in my second year of a masterâ€™s program in Applied
            Informatics, having previously graduated with a bachelor degree in Automation
            and Computer Science. I have a strong passion for web development and
            have gained practical experience working with various technologies
            such as Java, C#, relational and non-relational databases, React,
            HTML, and CSS. My background in both software development and system
            automation provides me with a solid foundation to build scalable and
            efficient applications across multiple platforms.
